### did you know there are 252 000 new webpages being published every day?

Every click generates **4.6 g CO2** what sums up to **553 kg CO2 annually**

Using EC0Lint the number can be reduced up to **0.2 g CO2**, so to only 24 kg CO2 annually, saving **529 kg CO2 (-96%!)**.

## about

EC0lint is an open-source tool for frontend developers. It's build on top of ESLint and checks not only code problems and styling, but also finds snippets which can be optimised in order to reduce carbon footprint left by your website.
